# Example: Bombay plague epidemic 1905--1906

Here we will explore fitting a simple $SIR$ model to the famous Bombay plague epidemic data (see e.g. @bombay:1907; @kermack_mckendrick:1927; @murray:2003). 

Firstly, load the `SimBIID` library:

```{r, plague-simbiid, warning = F, message = F}
## load library
library(SimBIID)
```

Then load in the data:

```{r, plague-data}
## read in the data and convert to vector
plague <- read.csv("plague.csv")
plague$Date <- as.Date(as.character(plague$Date), format = "%d %b %Y")
summary(plague)
```

These data are the number of deaths from ....

## SIR model

Recall, for a continuous-time SIR model we have rates of transition between states given by:
\begin{align*}
    P\left[\mbox{infection event in}~[t, t + \delta t)\right] &= \beta S I / N + o(\delta t)\\
    P\left[\mbox{removal event in}~[t, t + \delta t)\right] &= \gamma I + o(\delta t)
\end{align*}

## Summary statistics

In the first instance, as before, let's match to:

* final epidemic size (i.e. total number of removals across the time course of the epidemic), and
* time of final removal (in this case when the epidemic process ceased).

Although simple, these two measures serve to give us some information on both the *length* and *magnitude* of the epidemic, and should contain useful information about the parameters. In this case the final removal time is ??????? days and the final epidemic size is ????? individuals.

## Simulation model

In order to use the `ABCSMC()` function, we need to define a function that runs the simulations and returns an `NA` if the simulation is rejected, or a vector of summary statistics if it is not.

> **Note**: one thing to be careful of for this particular system, is that the data are aligned to time 0 being the time of the first *removal*, not *infection*. Just for illustration, we are going to simplify things in the first instance, and assume that the first infection happens 10 days before the first removal, which corresponds to adding 10 days to each of our observed removal times.

Copy-and-paste the function below. Go through this function and understand what each line is doing.

```{r, plague-setup}
## define the targeted summary statistics
data <- c(
    finalsize = 9219, 
    finaltime = 52
)

## set initial states
iniStates <- c(S = 977821, I = 1, R = 0)
```


```{r, plague-solsetup}
## set up models
transitions <- c(
    "S -> beta * S * I / (S + I + R) -> I", 
    "I -> gamma * I -> R"
)
compartments <- c("S", "I", "R")
pars <- c("beta", "gamma")
model <- mparseRcpp(
    transitions = transitions, 
    compartments = compartments,
    pars = pars,
    addVars = c("finalsize", "tol_R"),
    stopCrit = "R > (finalsize + tol_R)"
)
## compile model for use in ABC
model <- compileRcpp(model)
model
```

```{r,plague-solfunc}
    
## set up function to perform simulation
simSIR <- function(pars, data, tols, u, model) {
    ## run model
    sims <- model(pars, 0, data[2] + tols[2], u, data[1], tols[1])
    
    ## this returns a vector of the form:
    ## completed (1/0), t, S, I, R (here)
    if(sims[1] == 0) {
        ## if simulation rejected
        return(NA)
    } else {
        ## extract finaltime and finalsize
        finaltime <- sims[2]
        finalsize <- sims[5]
    }
    #print(c(finalsize, finaltime))
    
    ## return vector if match, else return NA
    if(all(abs(c(finalsize, finaltime) - data) <= tols)){
        return(c(finalsize, finaltime))
    } else {
        return(NA)
    }
}
```

```{r, plague-solpriors}
## set priors
priors <- data.frame(
    parnames = c("beta", "gamma"), 
    dist = rep("unif", 2), 
    stringsAsFactors = F
)
priors$p1 <- c(0, 0)
priors$p2 <- c(10, 10)
```

```{r, plague-solabc}
## set tolerances
tols <- c(
    finalsize = 10000,
    finaltime = 50
)

## run ABC-SMC algorithm
post <- ABCSMC(data, priors, simSIR, iniStates, tols, ptol = 0.5, ngen = 10, npart = 50, parallel = T, model = model)
```

```{r, plague-solplot, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5}
## plot approximate posteriors
plot(post)

## plot accepted outputs
plot(post, "output")

## summarise posteriors
summary(post)
```

```{r, plague-R0}
## function to calculate R0 and infectious period
R0fn <- function(beta, gamma) {
    data.frame(R0 = beta / gamma, infperiod = 1 / gamma)
}
summary(post, transfunc = R0fn)
```
```{r, plague-joint}
plot(post, gen = c(1, 10), joint = T)
```
