# Introduction

```{r, setup, child = "_setup.Rmd", include = F, purl = F, cache = F}
```

The purpose of this document is to run some ABC-SMC routines using the (current) `SimBIID` package (Simulation-Based Inference for Infectious Disease models), which is a package designed mostly for teaching purposes, to illustrate some of the ideas and routines discussed in the lectures. I am heavily indebted to [Stefan Widgren](http://www.it.uu.se/katalog/stewi333) for his fantastic [SimInf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SimInf/index.html) package, and indeed I shamelessly borrow some of his ideas (such as the `mparse()` function).

In the longer term, it would be good to have a fully `SimInf` supported version of this package, but for the time being I have developed `SimBIID` mostly as a tool to help you learn how ABC-SMC (and other routines) work, and to allow you to get your hands dirty with some real models/data, but without the complexities of having to code these routines up yourselves.

There are various general-purpose software packages for performing Bayesian inference for general classes of models. For example, 

* [WinBUGS](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/the-bugs-project-winbugs/)
* [JAGS](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/)
* [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/)

For general-purpose Bayesian modelling, with tractable likelihood functions, then I would recommend any of these packages. However, the problem from the infectious disease modelling perspective is that it is challenging to implement the kinds of models that we use in this course, particularly when we have missing or incomplete data, and non-standard likelihoods. An R package that is designed for modelling the kinds of system we focus on in this course is [pomp](https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/).

[pomp](https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/) (Partially Observed Markov Processes) is a powerful package that can be used to implement various "plug-and-play" inference algorithms, notably the maximum likelihood via iterated filtering (MIF) approach of @ionidesetal:2006, and a particle Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm [@andrieuetal:2010] based on the bootstrap particle filter [@gordonetal:1993; @drovandietal:2016]. It also includes some simple Approximate Bayesian Computation rejection algorithms, but not the ABC-SMC approach of @tonietal:2009. `pomp` also provides functions to efficiently simulate from state-space models. The interface is more complex than `SimInf` and `SimBIID` (it involves you knowing some small amount of C), and so for the purposes of this course the `SimBIID` package will serve as an entry point to these algorithms. There are also some general purpose ABC packages in R, such as the [`EasyABC`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/EasyABC/index.html) package. 

The `pomp` website: [https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/](https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/)---on [Aaron King's](https://lsa.umich.edu/eeb/people/faculty/kingaa.html) GitHub page---contains lots of tutorials to help you learn how to use this package, for those of you who wish to pursue any of these ideas further. The influenza in a boarding school data [@anonymous:1978] that we will use as a case study can be found here:  [http://kingaa.github.io/short-course/stochsim/bsflu_data.txt](http://kingaa.github.io/short-course/stochsim/bsflu_data.txt), although variations of the data can be found in other literature (e.g. @devriesetal:2006) and in the [`outbreaks`](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/outbreaks/index.html) R package.

The workhorse of `SimBIID` is the function `mparseRcpp()`, which apes the syntax of `mparse()`, but allows for different compilation and output options. It does not have the full power of `SimInf`, so currently only works on single node simulations (no networks), with some limited additional structures. It also implements a simple Gillespie algorithm, rather than the more sophisticated approaches used in `SimInf` and `pomp`, but it's fast enough for the examples here. It also allows for other things such as the inclusion of early stopping criteria, which often greatly help to improve efficiency in say ABC-SMC routines (particularly in poorly supported regions of the parameter space).
